This is a special work in progress which allows us to run tf.keras models remotely using Flask.

Let's begin by first listing down all available Features:

1. Activation:
* elu
* exponential
* hard_sigmoid
* linear
* relu
* selu
* sigmoid
* softmax
* softplus
* softsign
* swish
* tanh

2. Layers:
* Dense
* Dropout
* BatchNormalization
* LSTM

* Conv2D
* Bidirectional

3. Losses:
* binary_crossentropy
